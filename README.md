# CSLearning

This Repo contains tasks on a number of topics based on the topics set out in the survery you should have completed.
These tasks are designed to further test your knowledge and hopefully get you thinking about how to apply the things you do know.
There is no expectation for you to get all of these right and they are not being "graded" they are an attempt to find out what you need to learn more about
With that in mind please avoid googling answers to the tasks so we can get a clear picture of where you are currently.

## Setup

Clone the repo and run `npm ci` in the root directory.

## The tasks

Each task is split into a file with a series of questions, most questions will expect you to fill in a provided function with code that will answer a query or solve a problem.
At the end of the task please make a pull request on this repo with your answers in the files
To test any of your working the functions can be imported into `testing.js` and used there, running `npm run dev` will then run the testing file and output whatever you have set

Please let me know if you have any questions on anything regarding how to run the repo or complete the tasks
